Starbucks Locations Vs. U.S. Median Household Income

    This project analyzed whether or not there was a correlation between the number of Starbucks locations compared to the median household income of the area.
    The powerpoint presentation contains a full breakdown of all the data we looked at and analysis on all the figures. 
    We concluded that there was no significant correlation between the two datasets and found that most Starbucks locations were populated in areas where the median household income reflected the average U.S. median income ($68,703).
